# Chaotic Corruptions

This is a simple mod that enables the following configs aimed at randomizing or adding corrupted cards/items to your runs:

This has not been tested in multiplayer yet, so let me know if there are any issues!

| Config    | Default | Explanation |
| :------ | :----: | :--------- |
| EnableMod  | true |   Enables the mod. If false, the mod will not work then next time you load the game.    |
| EnableDebugging | true |   Enables debugging for if errors occur. Please enable this before submitting a LogOutput.log  |
| IncreaseCardCorruptionOdds    |   0    |  Adds a second roll to corrupt cards. 100 will make it guaranteed  | 
| IncreaseItemCorruptionOdds | 0 |   Adds a second roll to corrupt items. 100 will make it guaranteed   |
| GuaranteeCorruptCards | false |   Guarantees all card rewards are corrupted   |
| GuaranteeCorruptItems | false |   Guarantees all item rewardss are corrupted   |
| CorruptStartingDecks | false |   Forces all starting cards to be corrupted   |
| CorruptStartingItems | false |   Forces all starting items to be corrupted   |
| RandomizeStartingDecks | true |   Randomizes starting decks from all craftable cards. If CorruptStartingDecks is active, they are all corrupted   |
| CompletelyRandomizeStartingDecks | false |   Randomizes starting decks from all available cards for each hero's class regardless of if they can be crafted or not. If CorruptStartingDecks is active, they are all corrupted   |
| CraftableCorruptions | true |   Makes corrupted cards craftable   |
| CraftableCorruptionsCost | 800 |   The cost added to the regular crafting cost that will be added to the card's upgrade cost to craft the corrupted version. Note: this will be reduced by the town upgrade that reduces upgrade costs.   |
| OnlyCraftCorrupts | false |   Makes it so that the only cards you can craft are corrupted cards   |
| PurchasableCorruptPets (WIP) | false |   Makes it so that you can purchase corrupted pets   |
| PurchasableCorruptPetsMultiplier (WIP) | 200 |   The how much the corrupt pets cost relative to regular pets. So 200 would be twice the price.   |
